#my process for this completeing this book

I did not read the instructions for how to record the exersise answers until after I had finished the book. I have only built code for the certain exersices that found challenging enough that I needed to work out the answers. I understand the part about muscle memory an all that however ruby marks about the 10th language I've learned so I wanted to get through this fast and focus more time on what lies ahead. 

Exercises that are not reflected in this repository I either worked out on irb or did in my head. I will make sure to be more diligent and record my answers for the rest of the program.

There is no real organization by chapter, code hear is reflects the concept that were new to me that I have not come across in other languages. Some code is experimental and is not connected with any particular exercises.

I completed most of the final exersises and they are conducted all in one program exercises.rb 

I logged my time on toggl and with the ruby book I spent 6 hours working through this reading.
